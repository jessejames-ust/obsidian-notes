# Why use Obsidian?
So, why use Obsidian over other competitors like Notion or just Google Docs?
Personally found it easier here in Obsidian to stylize my notes. Here is my personal pros and cons with this software:
## Pros
- **Literally Free**
	- Although, there are other free alternatives but this is also free.
- **Massive Community Support**
	- There are so many community-made plugins available to fit your needs. From stylizing Obsidian's UI to improving core features.
- **No Account Required**
	- I really don't like having to create accounts for everything I use and when I found out that Notion required an account, it dawned on me. Not requiring an account made the decision for me easier.
- **MathJax Support**
	- For those who aren't aware, MathJax is an open-source engine made in JavaScript that displays mathematical notations in any platform that supports JavaScript and Obsidian is one of them. It makes complicated mathematical expressions cleaner to read and to type, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its own learning curve.
- **Uses Markdown for Styling**
	- A lot of platforms like Github and even Discord uses a lot of the formatting methods found in `.md`. Though maybe places like Discord has a limited support for it. Nonetheless, the essentials were there.
- **Lightweight software**
	- Without running a million plugins, Obsidian runs buttery smooth and doesn't consume much computing resources to run and use. This is especially good for laptops.
- **No Native AI Integration**
	- In other words, AI is not implemented by the developers as a feature. This is a plus for anyone like me who doesn't like AI being shoved in every piece of technology imaginable.
## Cons
- **Costs money to natively sync notes online.**
	- Of course, you can work around this with Google Drive and other cloud storages but it requires some work to get it working. It was annoying to find a free solution to this when wanting to sync notes on multiple operating systems like Windows and Android.
- **No native Github support**
	- You can use 3rd party solutions like the community plugins or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) but it can be a hassle.
- **No Grammar Checking**
	- Apart from spell checking, Obsidian has no native grammar checking.
# Conclusion
I prefer Obsidian because it's free, I don't need an account to use it, has a massive community support, MathJax support, easy and consistent styling. It is also lightweight to run on any device and platform and, best of all, no native AI integration.
